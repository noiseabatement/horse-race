this tricky game has no winner. 
this is my first project with HTML,CSS and JS.
no winner because keyframe animation is same with all 6 element.
chronometer does not working properly.
i failed to reset it.
also stop button does not stops animation, just starts time with 30 sec again.
if you click start button more than 1; it will trigger setInterval function again and again.
also this is the one of the problems that i couldn't solve.
i hope in the future, when i look to this code i will smile.
